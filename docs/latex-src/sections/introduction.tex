\section{Introduction}
% mention deep RL in the introduction
In the past decades, artificial neural networks have become a very popular solution when solving complex problems programmatically. In the course "Implementing ANNs with TensorFlow" we learned basic knowledge about the functioning of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and got to know the most relevant ANN types, their benefits and use-cases. One type of ANNs that caught our interest the most are deep reinforcement learning (RL) networks. In our project we wanted to apply our acquired knowledge to a real-world problem, as which we have chosen the game "Flappy Bird". In this documentation we will explain underlying choices we had to make before beginning our project, then describe our implementation, analyze how it performs and lastly summarize and evaluate our results.
