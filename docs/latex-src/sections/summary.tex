\section{Conclusion}

The goal of our project was the application of our acquired skills to a new problem, for which we chose the game "Flappy Bird". We decided to use deep reinforcement learning, more specifically Double Deep Q-Learning as an architecture to solve the problem. We created a working environment and an agent which used that environment to learn the game. In this task, we were successful. We also put our work into the greater context of scientific background knowledge, related work and evaluated it.  

\par
Beyond this general conclusion, we would also like to draw a more personal one: During the project, we experienced our first complete deep learning project, encountered many new things, overcame difficulties and had a great learning success. Insofar, the project was a nice ending of the IANNwTF course.
